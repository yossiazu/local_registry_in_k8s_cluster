# local_registry_in_k8s_cluster
The objective of this project was to provide a user-friendly workspace that would simplify the use of Docker images within our Kubernetes cluster. 
The project offers several benefits, such as centralized management and control of images, storage space management, and version control. Also, since the images are stored locally, it increases the ability to save them and prevents external access. 
The project is reliable thanks to Kuberantis, which ensures automatic repair and maintenance in case of any malfunction, ensuring that the project functions correctly.
